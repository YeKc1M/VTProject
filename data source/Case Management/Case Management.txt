1_2_Create_case_via_alternative_support_channels_GEN_V.pdf
Case Creation by Customers
Case Management

Purpose

Although Support Engineers can create Cases on behalf of the customers, SAP also offers the following channels to customers for the Case creation by themselves. 

The majority of the incoming cases are created by customers

Option A: SAP ONE Support Launchpad

Option B: Expert Chat

Option C: Emails

Customers can  report their issues via the link 
https://launchpad.support.sap.com/ to create 
new records.

NOTE: The record created in SAP ONE Support 
Launchpad is named as Incident. Pay attention 
to the naming difference when communicating 
to the customers.

For specific components, the customers can 
chat with an expert when reporting the issue in 
SAP ONE Support Launchpad, instead of 
creating an Incident in Support Launchpad 
(Case in NOW)

NOTE: For each chat, a Case in NOW system 
must be created by the Chat engineer.

It is a functionality available under specific 
conditions where customers can write an e-mail to 
a specific e-mail account  to create a Case

NOTE: In the Now System, cases created via e-
mail will be identified in the Source Channels as 
email (Automated)

Option D: Schedule an Expert (SaE)
Customers can create Schedule an Expert 
sessions for a group of SAP Products. SaE is a 30 
minutes one-on-one  live session with a SAP 
Support Engineer.
When Customers books a session, a case record 
is automatically created.

NOTE : The list of available products grow over 
the time and can be checked  by customers before 
book a session. 

Option E: Global Support Customer 
Interaction Center (CIC)

CIC provides a central point of contact for 
assistance with non-technical queries.

Customers can:

- get additional information about the 
status an Incident

- speed up the processing of an incident

- change Incident´s priority 

- request for Escalation

Option F: Build-In (CoPilot Digital 
Assistant) direct from the customer 
application

It is the possibility of creating a Case via the 
embedded digital assistant direct in the 
customer application that experiences the issue.

Option G: Solution Manager/ SAP Resolve

Partners or Customers can report an issue in their 
Solution Manager or SAP Resolve to create a 
record.

1_3_Verify_One_issue_per_Case_GEN_V.pdf
Verify One Issue per Case
At A Glance

Purpose

Ensuring a 1:1 ration between Issue and Case enables SAP to route and assign a case to subject matter experts for the subject reported striving for an efficient solution process.

Customers should report only one issue per Case to ensure SAP Support can provide a clear solution to a specific issue.

If more than one issue is reported the Support Engineer should 
▪ Ask the customer to create a new Case for each separate issue

▪ Attach SAP Note: 50048 More than one request in one message

Alternately, the Engineer can Create a Case on behalf of the customer (see: Create case on behalf of customer)

Why only one issue per incident ?
Reporting one issue per incident guarantees quicker assignment & incident processing because separate issues may be worked on by different Support Engineers in parallel rather than by one 
engineer in succession. 

The one issue per incident rule reduces complexity by narrowing the scope. This allows the engineer to focus on one topic and reach a resolution sooner.

Purpose

A Case is assigned to the appropriate Support Engineer based on the skillsets and resource 
capability to make sure that the issue is taken care of as soon as possible.

Best practice for manually assigning a Case – Next Action Monitor

Sort the column Next Action Due in the Next Action Monitor list in descending order when monitoring the 
list and pick up the first Case.

This helps ensure that Cases requiring immediate actions due to SLA fulfillment can be taken care of first.

1. Assign a Case

Option A: Assign a Case to yourself

Option B: Assign a Case to another Support Engineer

1a Monitor the Case list for unassigned Case

1a Monitor the Case list for unassigned Case

1b Assign the selected Case to yourself

1b Manually assign the Case to the appropriate Support Engineer

Option C: System automatically assigns a Case via 
Advanced Work Assignment (AWA)

Advanced Work Assignment (AWA) automatically assigns the 
Cases to qualified Support Engineers based on their 
availability, capacity, and skills. The assigned cases can be 
seen in Support Engineers’ Agent Workspace inbox.

Follow the steps here to set up your skills and capacity.

Manual Assignment

Automatic Assignment

Notes

▪ The Support Engineer is responsible to fulfill the SLA on ALL levels whenever he takes over the Case
▪ IRT is only fulfilled after the first qualified response is sent to the Customer via External Info in the Case
▪ Queue Manager needs to ensure the adherence to ORT and the processor (Support Engineer, Developer, or Operator) is responsible 

to fulfill the ORT

Downgrading Unjustified Priority 1 – Very High Case
Case Management

When to downgrade P1 Case?

the downgrading of the P1 Case. 

Click the hyperlinks to see the definitions and criteria for priority levels and how to communicate and document information using Interaction record.

How to downgrade P1 Case?

Step 1

Change Priority in the system.

Step 2 (if necessary)

If the Support Engineer needs to provide more 
internal information and reasoning for 
downgrading, document this internal comment in 
the Message field and select Message type as 
Internal Info.

Step 3

Click Save to update the record.

1

Note

This Downgrading Process does not 
apply to MA and AE customers. 

If an MA or AE customer disagrees to 
downgrade the priority, P1 should be 
retained. 

Best Practice – What if customer 
disagrees?

If customer disagrees to the downgrading 
when contacted, junior Support Engineer 
should consult manager or senior 
colleagues to review the judgement before 
changing the priority.

If the customer still disagrees and if the 
business units work with CIC, the Support 
Engineer can:

▪ advise customer to provide feedback to 

the respective country support via e-mail 
address support.<region>@sap.com (e.g. 
support.emea@sap.com).

▪ CIC will monitor this customer feedback 

which will be evaluated by the Support 
Management.

The SAP Support Interaction Survey (SIS) is a direct feedback channel to support, allowing customers to express their satisfaction regarding a particular incident, and the product related to that incident. It appears 
automatically once a customer confirms an incident in the SAP ONE Support Launchpad. It takes less than a minute to fill out the five questions, and a text area also allows customers to write additional feedback. The 
Scores range from 1 to 5, where 1 is very dissatisfied and 5 is very satisfied. The questions cover three topic areas: 

1) Satisfaction with Support for handling that particular incident 

2) Satisfaction with the SAP product affected by that particular incident 

3) Feedback on exactly which Notes/KBA solved particular issues

Scenario 1: Customer closes the case manually accepting the resolution

2a Customer is automatically redirected to fill the survey

The SIS questionnaire appears automatically when Customer confirms an incident in the 
SAP ONE Support Launchpad, or receives by e-mail.

2b Survey results are available

Survey results are available and accessible via Enterprise Analytics Store. 

Scenario 2: Case is automatically closed after 30 days

2a Survey is sent by e-mail 30 days after the case is automatically closed

Purpose

Validating Case information ensures that all required information has been provided and documented properly in the record in 
order to allow timely investigation and diagnosis of the issue. Cases that are accurately categorized become useful future input
element for various IT service management processes (e.g. Problem Management and Knowledge Management).

Best Practice for validating Case information

▪ Each Case record should only contain one issue. Follow the instructions here to 

split Case with multiple issues into individual Case records with single issue.

▪ If necessary, document steps to reproduce the reported issue in the Description 

field. Click here to see how to document steps for reproduction.

1. Validate All Case Information

2. Create Service Request (if necessary)

3. Request for Escalation (if necessary)

▪ Priority and Business Impact

▪ Component

▪ Contracts and SLAs

▪ EUDP Restriction

▪ Early Adopter Care Program and BETA

▪ Attachment

2a Create Service Request record via Case

Scenario 1:  Critical Incident Situation 

2b Fill in mandatory fields in the Service Request record

2c Save the record

3a Work in the current Case and provide information in 
Escalation record if necessary

Available in future release

Scenario 2:  Business Down Situation

3a Change Case’s Priority to P1 to trigger the automatic 
creation of Major Incident Candidate

3b Continue working in the Case and provide information in 
Escalation record if necessary

Scenario 3:  Critical Customer Situation

3a Request for escalation

3b Continue working in the Case and provide information in 
Escalation record if necessary

Available in future release

An Escalation record can be 
attached to a Case in the 
situation of escalation. 
However, the Support 
Engineers himself cannot 
create the Escalation record.

The trigger of escalation 
management process can 
be done at later stages of

determined and assigned by the Case Creator. However, Priority can 
be changed by the reporter or the Support Engineer if necessary.

Priority is categorized in 4 levels:

▪ 1 – Very High (P1) 

▪ 2 – High (P2)

▪ 3 – Medium (P3)

▪ 4 – Low  (P4)

More information regarding priority levels can be found here.

production system cannot be completed;

▪ The customer‘s core business processes are 

seriously affected;

What scenarios and business impacts are considered as Priority 1 – Very High?

Scenario /  Business Impact

Explanation

A productive system is completely down

▪ System goes down multiple times a day requiring restarts resulting in disruption of the core business process

▪ The entire system is technically down and cannot be brought back up

▪ Core business process is down without any feasible workaround.

The imminent system go-live or upgrade of a 
production system (as relates to an SAP 
system) can’t be completed

▪ Key Milestone (including Go / No Go decision for a project phase) is to happen in the next 5 business days and the customer is losing money as a result of a 

potential delay to the project.

▪ For test and quality systems very high priority will only be justified in the situations where they can jeopardize a production system

▪ Customers should be given the benefit of doubt and any ambiguity around the imminent Go-live definition should be addressed to the responsible person in 

the region where the customer is located

The customer's core business processes are 
seriously affected 

▪ A business process that can result in significant financial loss or legal ramifications if it cannot be executed on time (example: Shipping, Billing, Payroll)

And for each circumstance a feasible 
workaround is not available

▪ A workaround is considered feasible if it requires only minimal level of manual intervention from the customer for the short term

▪ An example of this would be utilizing a different business process to achieve the same end result, rescheduling the job to a different server/time of the day, 

etc.

▪ A workaround is not considered feasible if it requires the use of processes outside of an SAP system

Definitions of different processing times

IRT – Initial Reaction Time

MPT – Maximum Processing Time

APT – Action Plan Time

ORT – Ongoing Response Time

▪ MPT is the maximum time a customer can expect a 
solution to be provided to the request. It is the time 
between record arriving at SAP Support and solution 
confirmed by customer, or if the case is automatically 
closed by the system.

▪ APT is the time that starts when a record arrives at 
SAP support, contractually requiring the creation of 
an Action Plan (AP) or when the priority of existing 
SLA relevant Case becomes APT contract relevant. 

▪ ORT is the time that starts after the IRT is fulfilled and 

continues until the next update is sent to the 
customer. 

▪ ORT is defined by the current priority of the Case 

▪ APT is defined by the current priority of the Case AND

IRT is defined by the current priority of the Case AND 
the customer’s contract.

IRT should be met for all P1 and SLA relevant Cases.

IRT is calculated based on real time (24x7) for P1 Cases 
and office hours for P2 – P4 Cases.

Exceptions:

1. Preferred Care contract, : Real time (24x7) 

calculation for P2

2. Cloud contract CEC, CPC, and CPremium: real time

IRT is recalculated if the Case priority is changed 
(increased or decreased) as long as IRT has not been 
exceeded and not yet fulfilled.

IRT can be stopped with the first qualified response 
from SAP to the customer by using External Info and 
clicking Send Reply.

Notes

A Qualified Response is an update to the customer 
that moves the issue towards a solution:

▪ Minimum: Check for completeness (Language, 

Component, Priority, Example Data, System 
Access/Log-on Data) and provide customer 
with the results of this initial check. Examples 
are asking for more information & informing 
progress of solution.

▪ Give technical information about the issue.

▪ Provide solution if possible.

▪ MPT is defined by the current priority of the case.

▪ MPT is paused when waiting for customer action or 

solution provided to customer.

▪ MPT stops when the Case is confirmed by the 

customer or automatically confirmed by the system

when solution is provided.

Notes

Manual ORT:

▪ If you need longer time than the default 

proposed ORT, you need to manually overwrite 
the ORT and continue providing updates to the 
customers as promised.

▪ If the ORT Date & Time are manually adjusted 

or set, the ORT will no longer be reset 
automatically to a time prior to the manually 
adjusted Date & Time.

Scenario 1:  Critical Incident Situation

Critical Incident Situation is a scenario when the customer contacts the Customer Interaction Center (CIC) to request for the escalation of existing Case.

In this scenario, the Case only has the Escalation record associated. This is managed by the Critical Incident Management (CIM) team.

Notes

Instructions on how to provide information 
using Escalation records here.

Escalation Record Creation by CIM Manager On Duty

When the customer contacts the Customer Interaction Center for 
escalation, a Critical Incident Management request is triggered via the 
MCC SOS App. The ICP service request is then created.

Once the ICP service request is approved by the CIM Manager On Duty 
(MoD), the MoD manually creates the Escalation record for this specific 
Case in NOW. 

The Escalation record is displayed in the Escalation tab of the Case. 

Important Notes

The Escalation record can ONLY be closed by the CIM team. However, a Case can 
still be closed with Escalation record open. Once the Case is closed, the Escalation 
record will be automatically de-escalated.

is attached to this Major Case automatically if the escalation is triggered by Case.  If the escalation is trigger by Incident, initial Incident is 
attached to the Major Incident automatically.

Once the Major records are created, all Case(s)/Incident(s) created after the Major record creation will have their escalation requests 
manuallyrejected. These child records will be instead manuallyattached to the existing Major records.

Detailed work instructions on how to request escalation of a Business Down Situation will be available soon.

To communicate with the MCC processor, go to Escalation record of the Major Incident, select Message type as Work notes, and provide 
comment/information in the Work notes field.

Important Note: 

To communicate with the  LoB processor, go directly to the Major records, select Message type as Internal Info, and provide comment or 
information in the Message field:

▪ Go to Major Case to communicate with LoB specific escalation team;

▪ Go to Major Incident to communicate with Development or Operations team within the LoB.
