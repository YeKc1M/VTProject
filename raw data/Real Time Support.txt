SaE Session needs to be cancelled (by SAP)

The SaE sessions booked by customer are the highest priority. This should be considered before attempting to cancel or reschedule 
any sessions.
1. Make your line manager aware of this situation

2.

If you cannot make the session you have one of two options:

a) Option-1: Work directly with your colleagues and identify an Engineer who can take over the session from you. In this case, ensure all details are 

transferred to the Engineer taking over. Full details for transferring a session to another engineer here.

b) Option-2: Call the customer and inform them of the reason for cancelling the session, offer to cancel the session for them to be worked as a 

normal Case

1. To cancel the session in Service Now, go to the Appointment > Cancel SaE

2.

If prompted with a confirmation, click Yes to proceed with cancellation

any sessions.

Situations when you may need to cancel a session (this list may not include all situations, use best judgement when cancelling a
session).
• Customer doesn’t show up to session

• Session is booked for an area where SaE isn’t offered

• Customer requests session be cancelled but does not cancel themselves in the booking tool

• Customer requests increase in priority to high/VH (more details here)

Customer Cancel Session

Customers can cancel sessions directly through the booking tool. You will receive a notification that the customer has cancelled the 
SaE session.

•

There will be a Notification in the Activity section mentioning that the appointment has been cancelled by the customer.

The time-slot of Support Engineer will be freed and released in SaE tool as an “available slot”.

• No action from the support engineer is needed on the case.

Notes: 

Manual action for cancelled SaE case – Set to Customer Action

There is an open defect described in STRY0189058. When a customer cancels an SaE case, the customer is NOT set to “Customer Action” status automatically. Until this defect is fixed, please set the 
cancelled SaE case to Customer action manually by sending a Reply.

Analyze the issue / Collect information / Call to Customer

Analyze the issue

A deep dive is not necessary through a Chat session.  Analysis can involve the following:

1. Bug - Error Message -> steps to reproduce to get the error

2. How- To Question (Search for documentation, in WIPS check KM section)

3. New Requirement / Enhancement Request (direct customer to channel / community / Influence and Adopt Portal)

4. During the analysis phase assess every 30 minutes to determine if you are able to resolve issue in the session:

▪ Yes: continue assisting customer and resolve

▪ No: move to Collect Information

Collect information:

Working on complex issues means further analysis will be necessary or development input is required.  These steps cannot be completed during real time interaction with a 
customer.  Determine what additional information is required to continue your investigation before wrapping up the Chat session:

▪ Steps to reproduce with screenshots / Exact error messages in text form / Performance would have to be captured

▪ Logs and traces generation performed with customer on the session adds value and can be added to summary / action plan

▪ Authorization and Support Access should be checked, it adds value not to have to request these in a “Reply to Customer”, do it now

▪ OnPrem. Engineers also should get an Architecture diagram at this stage to add value (OS / Versions of Products/ 3rd party) 

Please Note

Our goal is to find the correct 
path to provide the best 
customer experience , consider 
best suited channels (if not chat):
▪ SaE
▪ Incident
▪ CIC
▪ Consulting (SAP Note: 83020)

Screen sharing / Remote Connection is applicable for the following situations:

Always create an incident before screen sharing or remote access to customer system since customer bulletin information is not visible in the Expert Chat Board yet.

▪ Based on customer request and no EUDP flag 

▪ It helps to make further understanding of issue easier

▪ With the customer online it is simpler to demonstrate and explain 

▪ Capturing the screenshots and/or logs during chat aids investigation

Is not applicable for the following situations:

▪ Customer bulletin has screen sharing / remote connection restrictions

▪ Customer declines screen sharing / remote connection

▪ EUDP flag set and you are outside EU

▪ Browser restrictions do not allow it or blocked

Expert Chat 2.0 – Getting an Expert Chat Session

2 Steps to Get an Expert Chat Session

Set your Agent Status

Accept an Expert Chat Session

Bold360 Agent Status

Bold360 Agent Workspace has four statuses: Available, Away, P1 Handling and Screen Locked

To be able to get chat session, your status should be set to Available

Status Available

Status Away

Status P1 Handling and Screen Locked

To be able to get chat session, your status should be set to 
Available 

Your status is automatically set to Away, if you don’t 
respond to an Expert Chat Session within 60 seconds, the 
chat is then reassigned to another agent.

P1 Handling and Screen Locked statuses are set 
automatically by the Chat Monitor Tool to prevent chat 
interactions been assigned to you when you are not 
available.

An agent who fails to answer in time is set to Away status to 
prevent new chats from being assigned. The agent must 
then explicitly set their status to Available. 

Away status should not be used deliberately. In case, you do 
not want to receive Expert Chats, logoff from Bold360 
Agent Workspace.

You can receive Handover Chats, when you have Away 
status.

Customer can only see the Start 
Chat button if at least one 
engineer is with status Available

Prepare for delivering SaE session

Based on the details provided by the customer in the SaE appointment, validate if you have all the information and 
tools at hand to deliver the SaE session.

Confirm if you need to do one or more of the following actions before the actual SaE session delivery:
1. Validate if all the information is available for you to deliver the SaE session. If not, call the customer to gather all 

the necessary information:

a) If customer is not reachable via phone, you can gather information via External Infovia 

the SaE Case to make customer aware that you need to reach him and the reason.

b) If the customer does not respond to the SaE case, you must still continue with the SaE

session!

c) The above guideline to continue with the SaE session also applies if the customer does 

not provide additional information you may have requested. In this case too, proceed with 
delivering the SaE session, making a best effort with the available context.

d) Continue the conversation about the request with customer within the case if necessary.

2. Gather links to self-help resources – KBAs, Community, Product documentation, etc.

3. Confirm that the information provided by customer matches the component chosen for booking SaE session.

4. Check if EUDP Regulations apply and if these may hamper the delivery of SaE session.

5. Record key points for reference in an Internal Info in SaE Case.

BEST PRACTICE:  
Call to confirm the customer has received the 
Skype meeting URL and is aware of the session, 
clarify his/her request if the information provided 
during booking is ambiguous. This is a good 
opportunity to set expectations for the customer 
so that he can be prepared and knows what is 
going to happen in the SaE session.

Notes

If the SaE session is assigned 
incorrectly, refer guideline here.

Deliver SaE session

Logon to the Skype Meeting Room at least 5 minutes before the scheduled start of the session.

Deliver session as soon as the customer joins the meeting.

Adhere to the standard WIPS guideline for following:

System Access & Log-on Data

Security Rules

EUDP Regulations

Consulting Requests

Keep a conscious watch on the time remaining – at the end of 25 minutes, confirm with the customer that you are 
on-track to complete the session in the scheduled 30 minutes. If you think there is added value to extend the 
session to .e.g. discuss more details or collecting more information about the scenario, communicate to the 
customer that the session can be extended with additional max. 30 minutes.

When ending the meeting, inform customer that you will update a summary of this meeting and Resolve the SaE
Case.

Notes

Refer to guideline on handling exceptional situations 
when delivering the sessions - here.

Close SaE session

Where all questions answered in session and does customer agree to close?

YES:

Document the summary of the SaE session in a External Info after you have ended the Skype Meeting and Resolve the Case. 

NO:

If the session needs to be continued and worked as normal, summarize the session and outline key topics covered. Change the Current Channel to Case. More details here.

When updating the Case:
▪ Ensure it is assigned to the correct component.

▪ Attach KBAs which are relevant in the context of the session.

▪ Summarize open actions, if any, for SAP Product Support.

▪ If the case needs further analysis in Product Support, summarize your findings and assign case to the correct queue.

If you have promised to provide the customer with additional documentation,

follow the standard WIPS guideline on Exchanging Files with Customers.

SaE Session needs to be rescheduled (by SAP)

The SaE sessions booked by customer are the highest priority. This should be considered before attempting to cancel or reschedule 
any sessions.
1. Make your line manager aware of this situation

2.

If you cannot make the session you have one of two options:

a) Option-1: Work directly with your colleagues and identify an Engineer who can take over the session from you. In this case, ensure all details are 

transferred to the Engineer taking over. Full details for transferring a session to another engineer here.

b) Option-2: Call the customer and ask them to reschedule in the booking tool. 

1. Direct contact over the phone must be made with the customer to cancel and/or reschedule the session to the next most convenient

time for the customer.

Notes

Rescheduling the session has to be done by the customer himself via the SaE booking tool; SAP 
cannot do this on customer’s behalf.

Reschedule session (by Customer)

Customers can reschedule sessions through the booking tool accessed via ONE Support Launchpad. You will receive a notification 
that the customer has rescheduled the SaE session. Then, in ServiceNow, it will show in the Activity panel that the appointment has 
been rescheduled.
•

If the SaE case is still assigned to you, follow the SaE process as if this was a new SaE case.

•

If the SaE case is not assigned to you anymore, the booking will be released in RCC and the same slot will then be made available as a free slot.

•

If you agree with the customer to reschedule and want to continue to be the one to hold the session but you did not get assigned after 
rescheduling, find the case, put your name as the processor of the appointment, and document this in an internal memo.

Notes

Rescheduling of sessions will still adhere to the 3 day booking lead time. If you and the customer 
agree to reschedule for an earlier window then managing this will be between you and the 
customer.

The Case needs to be forwarded to another organization (AIS, development) before the SaE session happens

Case

2. Cancel the session

How do I handle consulting topics? What if I’ve already spent the allotted time on a consulting discussion with the customer?

•

•

•

If consulting note 83020 has been attached, this indicates it was a consulting issue before the SaE session was scheduled and customer should be informed that SaE is not meant to be 
a consulting platform.

If consulting note 83020 has NOT been attached, use your best judgement to determine how to move forward and what expectations to set with the customer around consulting

Follow the SaE consulting WIPS

Customer has multiple questions in SaE session

Ask customer to create a new SaE / Case for the new questions.

me check  if someone is available.”

message in the chat window.

For warm handovers to CIC, the canned message 
/ps-gotocic can be used.

After informing the customer about the warm handover 
process, it is necessary to find an Expert in the receiving

discussion partner panel

Select the receiver Expert Chat queue

Click the Send Request button

Notes

you will forward the Interaction to
