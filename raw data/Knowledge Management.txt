Collect Information

Proactively searching for knowledge helps determine whether the current issue has already been reported and 
solved with known solutions or workarounds. Using the existing solution or workaround reduces organization's 
costs and ensure that approved polices and procedures are followed. 

When, no relevant knowledge are returned by the automated search’s initial recommendations, or a search is 
being performed outside of the record, information regarding the issue will need to be collected to perform a 
manual search. For example:

The words and phrases used in the process of searching for knowledge also become candidate content to 
improve existing knowledge articles or to create new articles if nothing exists. By searching early and often, 
everyone benefits from the collective experience of solving problems and answering questions, making it 
reusable, and evolving it to reflect organizational-level knowledge.

▪ Keywords used by customers to describe the issue and/or cause of the issue
▪ Processor’s own words to describe the issue and/or cause of the issue

Option A: ServiceNow Automated Search

Scenario 1: Agent Workspace – Using Agent Assist’s automated KBA recommendations

1a Open Agent Assist

ServiceNow Agent Workspace uses contextual search to auto-populate KBA recommendations 
based on a record’s Subject and provides those results in the Agent Assist sidebar of the record.
If the recommended results from Agent Assist return a published KBA as a solution, the KBA 
status will be either Released Internally or Released to Customer. However, only KBAs that 
are Published and Released to Customer can be accessed by the customers.

Step 1

Click the Academia Hat in the top right corner of the record to toggle 
the Assistant Sidebar on the right.

Step 2

Click the Academia Hat within the sidebar to access Agent Assist.

Agent Assist now appears in right hand sidebar.

Notes

What result is returned by Agent Assist?

▪ Agent Assist only returns KBAs stored in the NOW system.

▪ In Process and Technical Review KBAs will also be presented 
in Agent Assist and SAP xSearch. However, customers cannot 
access these KBAs unless they are Published and Released 
to Customer.

▪ All search options return the latest version of a KBA regardless 

of its published status (In Process, Review).

What result is NOT returned by Agent Assist?

▪ Any KBAs that have not been migrated from SAP’s i7P system

▪ SAP Notes, WIKIs, Guided Answers, Community Posts, Help 

Portal Documents, BCP Incidents, etc.

Use SAP xSearch find these additional resources if needed.

Option A: ServiceNow Automated Search

Scenario 1: Agent Workspace – Using Agent Assist’s automated KBA recommendations

1b Review list of recommended articles

Step 1

Review the populated list of recommended 
articles to determine whether a KBA can be 
potentially useful in solving the issue. 

How does Agent Assist work?

Agent Assist takes the text from the record’s 
Subject field and automatically performs a 
keyword search for matching KBAs.

Agent Assist searches the entire body of the 
KBA as well as the keywords and tags added 
to the KBA.

Agent Assist does not filter using the record’s 
component or product details. These details 
may need to be added manually to the search 
filter to narrow down results.

Notes

Internal KBAs

Whenever attaching knowledge articles, 
you must ensure the content is safe to 
send to a customer.

When a KBA is flagged as **INTERNAL 
USE ONLY**, do not paste the content 
into the External Info unless you are 
positive that it is safe to do so. If the 
content is not appropriate to send to the 
customer, work with the customer on the 
phone to execute the solution.

Make sure to only include safe text in the 
messages that your customer will read.

Internal KBAs can be attached to Cases 
(and should be if used in solution), but 
note that customers cannot access them 
unless they are set to Published and 
Released to Customer.

Agent Assist

▪ Only KBAs and KEAs stored in NOW 

are returned by Agent Assist. 

▪ SAP Notes, Help Portal Documents, 

WIKIs, etc. are not returned.

Purpose

When to update a KBA: 

Constantly updating outdated and/or incorrect content in the existing KBAs simplifies the Knowledge Base on the whole and 
improves the readability and reusability of existing KBAs. A KBA left with no change nor update adds none value to solving issues. 
It is everyone's responsibility to maintain the Knowledge Bases when the knowledge articles are being reused.

▪ Need to add new symptoms reflecting how the customer asked the question

▪ Need to add new symptoms or keywords to increase the searchability

All users are assigned with a KM 1 role in ServiceNow that allows them to edit and create KBAs.

▪ Add additional information to make the KBA more useable

▪ Hyperlinks or overall formatting of the KBA needs updating

▪ Content is incorrect

Notes

Best Practices for Editing

If editing from SAP xSearch, the steps 
outlined in the KM WIKI for KBA – Editing 
Published KBAs should be followed.

When and how to block KBAs?

If the KBA contains any personal identifiable 
information or GDPR-violated data, you 
should immediately remove the violation 
content and create a new version. 

A user with KM 3, KM 3 Coach or KM 
Compliance role can then block the outdated 
KBA version that contains the violation. 

▪ Click here to see how to block a KBA.
▪ The KM roles (levels) and permissions in

published.

▪ Only one draft version of a KBA can be 

created. However multiple users can update 
that draft version.

Step 3

Make updates to the KBA as needed.

You may follow the WIPS entry: Create a KBA

Best Practices

Data Protection and Security

▪ General Data Protection Regulation 

(GDPR) is the regulation that enforces 
the Data Protection and Security law.

▪ Screenshots from customer systems 

are NOT allowed in any Knowledge 
Management documentation.

▪ These regulations apply to all KBAs 

regardless of the KBA status.

▪ Do not display or disclose personally 

identifiable information (PII) or any 
other confidential information or 
information about our internal SAP 
servers in any part of the KBA 
(including screenshots, attachments, 
videos).

▪ Refer to the Data Protection and 

Privacy (DPP) page for further 
descriptions and guidelines on what 
personal data is.

Click here for more details and for steps 
on how to report a violation.

If the KBA contains a Data Protection / 
GDPR Violation, you should immediately 
create a new version and remove the 
violation content. A user with KM 3, KM 3 
Coach or KM Compliance role can then 
block the older outdated KBA version 
that contains the violation.

Purpose

Updating outdated and/or incorrect content in the existing KEAs provides the latest available information (e.g. workaround and 
symptoms) for the reported issue so that current information can be enriched and up to date. It is everyone's responsibility to 
maintain the Known Error Database when the knowledge articles are being reused. All users are assigned with a KM 1 role in 
ServiceNow that allows them to edit and create KEAs.

The Golden Standard Framework recommends users with at least KM 1 permission to have rights for editing and creating KEAs, 
while only Problem Coordinators assigned for the specific component(s) with KM Coach permission can approve and publish the 
KEAs for that component(s).

When to update a KEA: 

▪ Need to add new symptoms reflecting how the reporter asked the question

▪ Need to add new symptoms or keywords to increase the searchability

▪ Add additional information to make the KEA more useable

▪ Content and/or formatting is outdated or incorrect

Notes

Who can create KEAs?

All users are assigned at least KM 1 permission 
in ServiceNow that allows them to create and 
update KEAs.

The KM permissions in the system are explained 
here.

When and how to block KEAs?

If the KEA contains any personal identifiable 
information or GDPR-violated data, you should 
immediately remove the violation content and 
create a new version. 

A user with KM 3, KM 3 Coach or KM 
Compliance role can then block the outdated 
KEA version that contains the violation.

Purpose

KBAs are created to:

▪ Enable self-service strategy;

▪ Solve issues faster;

▪ Make upgrades and implementations smoother;

▪ Request for publishing the KBAs in a ore timely and structured approach.

Best Practices for Creating KBAs

KCS recommends to collaborate among various teams to capture the issue reported by the customer and provide the resolution of the issue in ONE 
KBA.

▪ When creating new KBA while working on the record in parallel, the original record processor should attach the KBA that is "In Process" to the record 

and transfer the record over to the new team for processing, if the component of the issue needs to be changed.

▪ Once the record is assigned to the new team, the newly assigned processor is should update and complete the KBA with the resolution found.

▪ Write the KBA in the way that customers can understand and avoid using jargons and internal terms.

▪ KBAs can be created during any 

state of the Case or Incident record. 

▪ KBAs can ONLY be created from 

Problem record during the state of 
Fix in Progress, Resolved, or 
Closed. 

Notes

Who can create KBAs?

All users are assigned a KM 1 role in ServiceNow 
that allows them to create KBAs. 

The KM roles (levels) and permissions in the 
system are explained here.

Always SEARCH before creating any new 
KBA to avoid duplicates.

read-only.

▪ Draft: The initial status of a newly-created KBA or one that is being fixed/edited and represents 
work in progress. The author can click Save to keep working on it in the future. It remains in the 
author’s KBA Inbox. A KBA is also set to Draft if it is sent back to be modified after it has been 
reviewed. Important: NEVER leave the Processor field blank.

▪ Review: The KBA is considered completed by the author. This status is used when submitting a 

KBA to a KM Coach for review. Regardless of the KM roles, the KBAs must be reviewed and 
approved before publishing.

▪ Published: The KBA is approved for publishing and is accessible to the defined target group.

▪ Pending Retirement: The KBA has requested for retirement and the approval request is 

generated automatically. KBAs with release status of Pending Retirement are not viewable by

be used when a KBA is no longer relevant. See WIPS entry: Update a KBA for more details about 
when this status can be used.

i.

Target: This field sets the target audience of the KBA. 

▪ Released Internally: The KBA is approved for internal use by other engineers. Either the KBA 

requires more validation before being published for use by customers, or the KBA contains 
proprietary information that is not appropriate for the customer to have access to. See KM WIKI: 
Released Internally for more best practices.

▪ Released to Customer: The KBA is approved for use by customers.

Main Body Content

It is important that the main body content is documented correctly to provide the accurate and 
latest knowledge information. Some sections are optional for the content creation.

Mandatory fields (marked by red asterisk *) must be completed before the KBA can be saved. The 
KBA Content Standards Guide provides best practices for the text management.

KBA Main Body

▪ Title * : Short description of the KBA Topic

▪ Symptom * : Describe the issue/question in a concise and clear way using the most important details. It is 

recommended to use how the customer describes the issue.

applies to a specific operating system, feature, function).

▪ Reproducing the Issue (optional): When the information is known, provide the exact steps (workflow) that 

reproduces the issue. Use a numbered list when providing the exact steps.

▪ Cause (optional): When the information is known, clearly state the underlying cause to help others understand 

why issues (problems) occur. If the cause is about a product bug, add the appropriate information (if it applies to 
your product line).

▪ Resolution * : The Resolution section should never be empty! The resolution must address the issue/question 

stated in the symptom section. By following these clearly stated actions, the symptom(s) should disappear after 
the resolution has been applied.

▪ See Also (optional): This area can be used to add additional information such as helpful references or useful links. 

▪ Keywords (highly recommended): Keywords can help a KBA be more searchable by adding words a customer 

may search on (e.g. BOE, ASE), commonly misspelled words, CR number, etc.

Other Fields

The KBA Form consists of several other fields that help manage the KBA content and reporting. See below on when and how these fields should be used.

Expires on – When to use it?

The Expires on field, is an optional field that can be used to remind you that a KBA should be updated or 
archived on a specific date.

Bridge KBA

Note: This field is automatically populated 5 years from creation date. However the default date can be 
removed.

Expires on – How does it work?

▪ Email notifications will be sent from the system to the name displayed in the Responsible field as a 

reminder to update or archive the KBA.

▪ Email notification will be sent at these intervals: 4 weeks, 2 weeks, 3 days, and the day when the KBA 

expires or until the KBA is updated and the Expires on  date has been changed/removed.

▪

If the Expires on date is met, the system will change the KBA status to Retired.

A Bridge KBA allows engineers to bridge a gap in searchability or usability of other knowledge repositories for our 
customers to ensure they can successfully self-serve themselves. A Bridge KBA can hyperlink to an existing knowledge 
document or repository to make the solution more searchable or usable for the customer. 

We add value to the Knowledge Base by adding customer context and using customer words as much as possible.

▪ The Bridge KBA flag is only used on a KBA that directly refers to a solution in another document type (SAP Note, SAP 

Community WIKI page, Help Portal document, Guided Answer, 3rd party documentation) but has no specific solution in 
the KBA itself.

▪ A KBA with an actual solution that also includes references to other supporting documents (other KBAs, Support Portal 

pages, etc.) would not be a Bridge KBA.

▪ More Information can be found on the KM WIKI Bridge KBAs.

How to fill in KEA information in UI16?

Detailed explanations for each of the fields in the KEA can be found here.

KEA Tags (only available in UI16)

How to review tags on a KEA?

1. Click the 3-dot icon (…) in the header of the KEA to open the context menu.

2. All tags that have been added to this KEA are displayed in the Tags section.

necessary.

How to add tags on a KEA?

Different from editing the keywords for the KEA, adding tags does not affect the 
Release Status of the KEA (i.e. the status will NOT change to Review), nor does 
it require any publishing approval.

1. Click the 3-dot icon (…) in the header of the KEA to open the menu list.

2. Click Add Tag. This activates a free text field at the bottom of the tag list 

that any tag information can be entered.

3. Start typing free text for each tag in the field. If there are any matching 

tags, they’ll be suggested as you type.

4. Once done typing or selecting an existing tag, press Enter on keyboard to 

save the tag and enter another if needed.

Note: Unlike editing Keywords field in the KEA record, adding or deleting tags in 
the KEA does not require republishing. The tags are immediately updated even 
if the article is currently published.

Retire a KBA

Purpose

When to retire a KBA: 

Retiring KBAs that are obsolete, invalid, irrelevant, and/or duplicate makes the Knowledge 
Bases neat, up to date, and organized, thus simplifying the user experience and encouraging 
self-services whenever possible.

▪ The KBA points to a location that is invalid and there is no corresponding location to point to;

▪ The KBA is specific to a technology that is no longer used;

▪ The KBA references a product that has reached its end of life, is no longer supported, and it is not 

appropriate to update the KBA to make it current;

▪ The KBA is a duplicate. 

1. Determine if KBA Needs to be Retired

2. Update KBA for Retirement

Notes

1a Review KBA content to confirm the need for 
retirement

1b Follow up with KM Coach or consult senior colleagues 
if unsure about whether to retire a KBA

2a Open KBA in Edit mode by creating a new version

2b Update Symptom field with achieved reason

2c Save the updates for the article and change the 
status of the KBA to Pending Retirement

What happens when you retire a KBA?

Once the KBA is approved to be retired (i.e. the approval request for pending 
retirement is approved), the status of the KBA changes to Retirement and cannot be 
edited (including KBA version blocking) and republished.

3. Retire KBA

3a Set the status of the KBA to Pending Retirement

3b Retire the KBA

3c Retrieve a KBA with status of Pending Retirement for 
re-publishing (if applicable)

What happens when KBA status is changed to Pending Retirement?

If a KBA has a status of Retired or Pending Retirement, it can still be searched 
internally if it is referenced to elsewhere and these links remain valid internally. 
However customers will not be able to access these KBAs. 

Retiring a KBA results in broken links and references in other articles if these retired 
KBAs are referenced to. Therefore, you should always try to update or “Flag and Fix” 
the KBA rather than retiring the article unless it’s absolutely necessary.

How to handle duplicate KBAs?

It is recommended to keep the oldest KBA (the one that has the oldest date) and 
update or fix the oldest one by adding the information from the newer KBA and then 
retire the newer KBA.

2. Update KBA for Retirement
Knowledge Management

Update the KBA’s Title and Symptom to clearly indicate that this KBA has been retired with specific reasons. This helps other users to quickly identify in the search results that the KBA 
returned from the search is retired. It’s also important to state the reason for retirement to reduce the chances of the KBA being republished or outdated information being shared.

You MUST first update and republish the KBA with the updated Title and Symptom before retiring the KBA because the article’s title and body content cannot be edited anymore once the 
Release Status is changed to Pending Retirement.

Step 1

Click Edit in the KBA to open the Edit mode and then click New 
Version.

See WIPS entry for Update a KBA to know how to update to new 
version.

Step 2

Go to the Symptom field and enter the archived reason in red at 
the top of the symptom field.

Example: if the KBA is a duplicate of another KBA, enter the 
following archived reason in red:

***Archive Reason: Duplicate of KBA 1234567***

Step 3

Click Publish to save the changes. 

The article’s Release Status changes to Review.
