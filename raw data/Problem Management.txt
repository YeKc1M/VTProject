Create a Problem

Purpose

A Problem record is created to:
▪ Capture all necessary information from the related cases/incidents.
▪ Request the responsible development and/or operations teams to identify the cause of a reported issue.

The document explains two options to create a Problem record in NOW system.

1. Create a Problem Record 

Option A: Create Problem via Case/Incident Module

Option B: Create Problem via Problem Module

1a Navigate to Case/Incident Module and create the new Problem 
record

1b Fill in the mandatory fields in the Problem record and save the 
Problem

1a Navigate to Problem Module and create the new Problem record

1b Fill in the mandatory fields in the Problem record and assign the 
Problem

Notes

When to use which option?

It is recommended to create Problem record via the Case 
or Incident Module if there is already Case/Incident record 
opened as some of the existing information can be 
replicated from the Case/incident record directly to the 
Problem record.

When an issue is detected without any Case/Incident 
record being created, it is recommended to create 
Problem record via the Problem Module.

2. Perform Root Cause Analysis (RCA)
Problem Management

Option B: Perform RCA by creating Problem Task and assigning to processor

2a Coordinator creates a new Problem Task record and assigns the task to specific assignment group to perform RCA 

What is problem task?

Step 1

Go to Problem Tasks tab and click New to open a new Task record.

1

2

A problem task is the smallest unit of work that you should perform to complete a 
problem. A problem can be divided into multiple problem tasks which can then be 
easily assigned to different assignment groups or processers.

The Problem Task records capture individual tasks for this Problem record and can be 
worked on by different processors in parallel. 

What is the purpose of using Problem Task records?

The Problem Task records are only used as task reminder and KPI calculation for the 
problem management process. The assigned processor or approver should ALWAYS use 
the Problem record to document the result of the root cause analysis. 

You do not need to document the result in the Problem Task records, but you can use the 
task records to post internal notes. The Problem record can be closed with open Problem 
Tasks. Once the Problem is closed, all the task records will be automatically closed.

What are the types of Problem Task record?

▪ Root Cause Analysis: Task to investigate the root cause of a problem and if 

possible find a resolution for the problem

▪ Root Cause Analysis Review: Task to approve or reject the result of the RCA

▪ Corrective Task: Task to correct the occurred issue

▪ Preventive Task: Task to prevent the recurring issue from happening in the future

▪ General: All other tasks

Purpose

Problem Coordinate communicates the RCA to the involved stakeholders to ensure communication transparency 
among all stakeholders.

Most of the created KBAs are classified as Known Error Articles that capture all necessary information in the 
Problem records (e.g. workaround, steps reproduce, affected systems, etc.) to deflect future cases/incidents. 
Once the Known Error Article is published, the problem will be listed in the Known Error Database.

Knowledge Articles – which one to create?

▪ Known Error Articles (KEAs) are created to document the known errors once the 

root cause has been found. KEAs are only created for Problems and can be retired 
once the known error has been resolved permanently.

▪ Knowledge Base Articles (KBAs) are created to capture and share knowledge 
across the organization to improve efficiency by reducing the need to discover 
knowledge. KBAs can be created for any record type (e.g. Case, Incident, Problem).

1. Coordinator communicates RCA (if applicable) 

2. Create or Update Knowledge Articles (if applicable) 

Notes

Scenario A: Problem without related case(s)

Scenario B: Problem with related case(s) and affecting single LoB 

1a Send RCA to both internal stakeholders and Support Engineer who has 
created the Problem record

1b Support Engineer communicates RCA to affected customer

Scenario 2: Existing KEA found but requires update

Available in future release

See WIPS entry for Update a KEA

Option B: Create or Update Knowledge Base Articles (KBAs)

Scenario 1: No existing KBA found

See WIPS entry for Create a KBA

Scenario C: Problem with related case(s) and affecting multiple LoBs

Scenario 2: Existing KBA found but requires update

1a Send RCA to internal stakeholders and SWAT team

1b SWAT team communicates the RCA to customer

See WIPS entry for Update a KBA

Best Practices for Documenting Resolution

▪ Always search for existing knowledge articles 
before creating anything new in order to avoid 
duplicate records. 

▪

If the information provided in the knowledge 
articles is obsolete, invalid, irrelevant, and/or 
duplicate, retire the knowledge article whenever 
necessary.

Where to find Code Correction record in NOW?

Once the code creation issue has been created in the 
development system, the Now system automatically creates a 
Code Correction record that is linked to the development system 
if it’s been integrated with NOW. 

The NOW Code Correction record is saved under the Code 
Corrections tab of the Problem record. It is read only for all the 
detailed information as such information is replicated from and 
updated by the linked development system (e.g. Jira).

Scenario 1: Implement code correction for cloud products

1b Processor creates code correction request

Applicable for development 

system NOT integrated with NOW

When a Problem is created with component that DOES NOT have its system integrated with NOW, a Code Correction record needs to be created in NOW first. Then you need to create 
a Bug/Issue in your defined development system and link the Bug/Issue with the NOW Code Correction record.

Step 3

Step 4

Manually go to the development system and create a Bug/Issue in that system.

Go back to NOW and click Copy Issue ID to copy the NOW Code Correction record’s issue ID. 

3

Step 5

In the development system, paste the NOW Issue ID to 
the corresponding field (e.g. snowID in TagretProcess) 
and save the record.

Once this field is updated, the development system 
automatically sends the Bug/Issue information to NOW 
and updates the Code Correction record in NOW 
automatically.

Step 1

Go to the development system, fill in the mandatory information in 
the development system, and create new issue record in the 
development system. This record number is automatically 
documented in the NOW system in the Code Correction record as 
Issue ID.

Stakeholders listed in the NOW system’s Internal notes list will be 
automatically notified via system email about the new creation of 
Code Correction record.

Step 2

Perform the code correction. Then update the closure information 
in the development system and close the record in the development 
system. 

Step 3

The NOW Code Correction record is also automatically updated and 
closed.

What is problem task?

Step 4

Go to Problem Tasks tab and click New to open a new Task record.

2

A problem task is the smallest unit of work that you should perform to complete a 
problem. A problem can be divided into multiple problem tasks which can then be 
easily assigned to different assignment groups or processers.

The Problem Task records capture individual tasks for this Problem record and can be 
worked on by different processors in parallel. 

What is the purpose of using Problem Task records?

The Problem Task records are only used as task reminder and KPI calculation for the 
problem management process. The assigned processor or approver should ALWAYS use 
the Problem record to document the result of the root cause analysis. 

You do not need to document the result in the Problem Task records, but you can use the 
task records to post internal notes. The Problem record can be closed with open Problem 
Tasks. Once the Problem is closed, all the task records will be automatically closed.

What are the types of Problem Task record?

▪ Root Cause Analysis: Task to investigate the root cause of a problem and if 

possible find a resolution for the problem

▪ Root Cause Analysis Review: Task to approve or reject the result of the RCA

▪ Corrective Task: Task to correct the occurred issue

▪ Preventive Task: Task to prevent the recurring issue from happening in the future

▪ General: All other tasks

Document Problem Resolution

Purpose

The output from Problem Management includes information and documentation concerning workarounds, known 
errors, and permanent solutions. Documenting the resolutions, especially the permanent solutions, improves 
organizational learning experience and allows Support Engineers, Developers, and Operators to know how to deal 
with issues that have previously been resolved and documented.

Developers and operators can document the resolutions in two types of knowledge articles: Knowledge Base Articles 
(KBAs) and Known Error Articles (KEAs).

Knowledge Articles – which one to create?

▪ Known Error Articles (KEAs) are created to document the known errors once the 

root cause has been found. KEAs are only created for Problems and can be retired 
once the known error has been resolved permanently.

▪ Knowledge Base Articles (KBAs) are created to capture and share knowledge 
across the organization to improve efficiency by reducing the need to discover 
knowledge. KBAs can be created for any record type (e.g. Case, Incident, Problem).

1. Document Resolution in Knowledge Articles

Option A: Document resolution using KBAs

Option B: Document resolution using KEAs

Notes

Scenario 1: No existing KBA found

See WIPS entry for Create a KBA

Scenario 2: Existing KBA found but requires update

See WIPS entry for Update a KBA

Scenario 1: Known error has been successfully resolved 
with permanent solution

See WIPS entry for Retire a KEA

Scenario 2: Known error will be resolved in the future 
once permanent solution is available

Available in future release

Scenario 3: Existing KBA found but obsolete or invalid

See WIPS entry for Update a KEA

See WIPS entry for Retire a KBA

Best Practices for Documenting Resolution

▪ Always search for existing knowledge articles before creating 

anything new in order to avoid duplicate records.

▪ If the information provided in the knowledge articles is obsolete, 
invalid, irrelevant, and/or duplicate, retire the knowledge article
whenever necessary.
