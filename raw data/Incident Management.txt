Purpose

An Incident is created to:

▪ Document all information and history of the record to provide service and support to the internal requestor and 

external customer (via case);

▪ Request clear prioritization for proper diligence to facilitate swift and effective resolution.

Best Practice for Handling Incident with Multiple Issues

Each Incident record should only contain one issue. If an Incident has multiple issues 
reported, split the Incident into individual Incidents with each reporting only one issue. 

More information can be found here.

Notes

Major Incidents can be created when you have the need to 
Bundle multiple incidents. Bundling is used to relate a 
common major incident for ease of resolution and 
communication to affected requestors.

Provide Resolution

Purpose

The Incident Processor provides the resolution to the requestor  in order to rectify the issue that has been identified. The recovery can be 
performed either by IT support staff or by providing the requestor with a set of instructions to follow.

The incident Processor should also update the Knowledge Database whenever possible to improve organizational learning experience and 
allow others to know how to deal with issues that have previously been resolved and documented.

Resolution Note Handling

If the Incident has any related Incident and/or Problem record, the 
record with the latest resolution always overwrites the Incident 
record’s Resolution note field. 

Previous resolution information in the Incident is saved and 
displayed in the Activity Stream of the Incident.

1. Test the Resolution (if necessary)

2. Provide the Resolution and Inform Requestor

1a Test the resolution provided

1b Validate whether the resolution can recover the 
impacted services 

Scenario 1: Testing is successful for Cloud product

Create Change record to implement the resolution (future 
release)

Scenario 2: Testing is successful for On-Premise 
product

Provide the resolution directly to requestor

Scenario 3: Testing is NOT successful

Repeat the investigation and diagnosis process until the 
testing is successful (Link to WIPS Investigate and 
diagnose)

Notes

Testing is done outside of Service Now product. 
When complete perform step 2 within Service Now.

1a Document the resolution in the Incident

1b Update the resolution information of the Incident

1c Add and finalize additional information relevant for the 
resolution

1d Send the resolution to the requestor

3. Create code correction

Notes

An Escalation record can be attached to a Incident 
in the situation of a case escalation. 

The trigger of case escalation management process 
can be done at later stages of Incident management 
too.

When validating an incident, it may be necessary to 
document how to reproduce the issue. How to

▪ Normal business processes are seriously

▪ Normal business processes are affected.

▪ The problem has little or no effect on

▪ Necessary tasks cannot be performed.

▪ Issue is caused by incorrect or inoperable 

functions in the SAP system that are 
required immediately.

▪ The issue is to be processed as quickly as 

possible as a continuing malfunction can 
seriously disrupt the entire productive 
business flow.

▪ The problem is caused by incorrect or 

inoperable functions in the SAP system.

▪ The problem is caused by incorrect or 

inoperable functions in the SAP system that 
are rarely used or not required daily.

for normal business processes or IT 
processes related to core business 
processes. 

▪ Urgent work cannot be performed. 

▪ This is generally caused by one of more of 

the following circumstances:

▪ A productive system is completely down;

▪ The imminent system go-live or upgrade 

of a production system cannot be 
completed;

▪ The customer‘s or requestor’s core 

business processes are seriously affected;

▪ A workaround is not possible for each of 

the circumstances mentioned above.

▪ The issue requires immediate processing 

because the malfunction may cause serious 
losses.

▪ In case of go-live or upgrade, the reason to 
delay go-live or upgrade must be one that 
would cause serious losses if not resolved 
beforehand.

What scenarios are considered as 1 – Very High?

Scenario /  Business Impact

Explanation

A productive system is completely down

▪ System goes down multiple times a day requiring restarts resulting in disruption of the core business process

▪ The entire system is technically down and cannot be brought back up

▪ Core business process is down without any feasible workaround.

The imminent system go-live or upgrade of a 
production system (as relates to an SAP 
system) can’t be completed

▪ Key Milestone (including Go / No Go decision for a project phase) is to happen in the next 5 business days and the customer is losing money as a result of a 

potential delay to the project.

▪ For test and quality systems very high priority will only be justified in the situations where they can jeopardize a production system

▪ Customers/Requestor should be given the benefit of doubt and any ambiguity around the imminent Go-live definition should be addressed to the responsible 

person in the region where the customer/requestor is located

The customer's core business processes are 
seriously affected 

▪ A business process that can result in significant financial loss or legal ramifications if it cannot be executed on time (example: Shipping, Billing, Payroll)

And for each circumstance a feasible 
workaround is not available

▪ A workaround is considered feasible if it requires only minimal level of manual intervention from the customer for the short term

▪ An example of this would be utilizing a different business process to achieve the same end result, rescheduling the job to a different server/time of the day, 

etc.

▪ A workaround is not considered feasible if it requires the use of processes outside of an SAP system

Component
1a Check the original component provided by the requestor and prepare handover information if adjustment is needed 

Step 1

Step 2 (if applicable)

Based on the information provided in the Incident check 
whether the correct component has been chosen by the 
requestor. 

Based on the initial analysis, if the Incident processor decides that the component needs to be changed, Incident processor 
should document the findings in the Message field and choose the Message type as Internal Info.

Recommendation is to provide at least the following information :

▪ Issue description in your own words 

▪ System details (where available or already documented in Incident)

▪ Recreate previous steps to analyze/ reproduce the issue

name in the Component field, or by 
searching via the component list.

Step 2

EUDP Restriction
EUDP Remote Access restrictions do NOT apply to employees that are physically located within the EU and EFTA areas.

Step 1

The type of Data protection & security is 
displayed in the System section and is prefilled by 
the Installation.

Step  2 (if necessary)

In case of emergency and the requestor requires 
immediate support, the Incident processor can 
request the requestor deactivate the EUDP 
restriction. 

Once the requestor deactivates the restriction, the 
EUDP deactivated box will be automatically 
checked.

Notes

As the Incident processor does not 
communicate with the customer 
for CASEs, then If the EUDP needs 
to be deactivated, the Incident 
processor would need to ask the 
Case processor to ask the 
customer for that
